# Welcome to AMATH 586 (Spring 2021)

On this page you will find homeworks, sample code, usually in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and additional materials and resources.

For assignment discussion and submission we will use:

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com)

Accompanying each assignment is a link for you to initialize a repository.  The code you write for the assignment should be put there.  It allows you to ask specific questions about specific lines of code and allows me to comment directly on your code.  Also, it's good to get used to `git`. 

You can sign up for the discussion board here: piazza.com/washington/spring2021/amath586 using code `time_dep`.

Lastly, homeworks will be submitted via gradescope: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/257911

These are optional additional lectures going into certain topics to a deeper level.

Please check the handwritten notes for the update.
